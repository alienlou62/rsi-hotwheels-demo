RSI Hot Wheels Demo
A mechanical demonstration showcasing the precision of the RMP system at Robotics Systems Integration (RSI).
This system features a user-adjustable ramp, a sensor-triggered gate, and a floor-based catcher to intercept a Hot Wheels car.
Real-time speed measurements are used to predict trajectory and coordinate system timing.

Features
Adjustable ramp angle via motor and encoder

Real-time speed sensing with dual sensors
