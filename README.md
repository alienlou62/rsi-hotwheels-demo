# rsi-hotwheels-demo
A mechanical demo of RMP accuracy at RSI using a Hot Wheels track with a user-set, motor-controlled ramp angle, a door that opens just before the car arrives, and a floor-based catcher. Two sensors measure speed to predict trajectory and coordinate precise, real-time actuation.
